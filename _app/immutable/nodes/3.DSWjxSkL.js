I was enjoying
					simpler, indie games and decided to attempt making one. Unity was the mainstream game
					engine at the time so I learned C# and did a massive amount of research. By the end of it,
					I had developed a few small games and a strong desire to learn more about software as a
					whole.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2024 / Former-Half</span> - Frontend Web Development</h4> <p class="font-light">As I was exploring different applications of software, I came to realize that the web was
					one of the most impactful and accessible platforms. My priority, then, was to master the
					fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS. I built many smaller apps using just the basics and
					began to realize the importance of accessibility, scalability, and modularity.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2024 / Latter-Half</span> - Backend Development</h4> <p class="font-light">As I continued to research, I finally realized that to bring many of my ideas to life, I
					would need to venture into the backend. I compared most of the major fullstack frameworks
					and decided that SvelteKit would best suit my needs. Up until this point I had largely
					avoided anything related to the server. I became really interested in the interplay
					between client and server, and I discovered how much I enjoyed backend development.</p> <p class="font-light">This recognition inspired me to explore other backend tools and technologies. This was
					when I was first introduced to Go. Initially, there were a few hurdles to my
					understanding, but I quickly came to enjoy the pillars of simplicity and explicitness that
					it encouraged.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2024 / Latter-Half Cont.</span> - Started University</h4> <p class="font-light">I began my first year as an Honors CS student at the University of Central Florida (<abbr title="University of Central Florida">UCF</abbr>) and joined Knight Hacks—a club which has had a major impact on my journey as a
					developer. Through Knight Hacks, I attended my first two hackathons which reinforced my
					passion about development and collaboration.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2025 / Former-Half</span> - First Job in Tech</h4> <p class="font-light">After a semester of university, I wanted to take on a job in addition to my courses. I
					heard about a web development position from a member of Knight Hacks and decided to apply.
					A few weeks later I became a <!> at <abbr title="University of Central Florida">UCF</abbr>.</p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2025 / Former-Half Cont.</span> - CLI and Lower-Level Development</h4> <p class="font-light">As I continued my exploration of the many fields in software, Rust caught my interest.
					Since then, Rust has become one of my main areas of focus in my free time. In addition to
					Go, Rust is one of the primary languages I enjoy using to build CLI tools and other
					lower-level projects.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2025 Latter-Half</span> - More Hackathons</h4> <p class="font-light">I had the opportunity to once again participate in two hackathons. My team's project at
					the first hackathon was <!>, a Chrome extension that made use of the Gemini API to creatively correct accessibility
					issues. It was capable of adjusting inline CSS to fix contrast issues in images and could
					generate alt text.</p> <p class="font-light">At the second hackathon, we ended up winning <b>Best Game</b>. Our project was a fighting
					game called <!> where one of the players was controlled with an EEG. The game turned out really well given
					the time constraints and the inputs were impressively accurate. If you're interested, you can
					read more about the story behind this project on <!>.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary"> </span> - Now</h4> <p class="font-light">I'm still attending <abbr title="University of Central Florida">UCF</abbr>, I'm a
					Techranger, and I'm still working on projects with Rust and Go. If you're interested, you

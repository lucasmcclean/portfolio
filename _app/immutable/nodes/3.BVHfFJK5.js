I was enjoying
						simpler, indie games and decided to attempt making one. Unity was the mainstream game
						engine at the time so I learned C# and did a massive amount of research. By the end of
						it, I had developed a few small games and a strong desire to learn more about software
						as a whole.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2024 / Former-Half</span> - Frontend Web Development</h4> <p class="font-light">As I was exploring different applications of software, I came to realize that the web
						was one of the most impactful and accessible platforms. My priority, then, was to master
						the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS. I built many smaller apps using just the basics
						and began to realize the importance of accessibility, scalability, and modularity.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2024 / Latter-Half</span> - Backend Development</h4> <p class="font-light">As I continued to research, I finally realized that to bring many of my ideas to life, I
						would need to venture into the backend. I compared most of the major fullstack
						frameworks and decided that SvelteKit would best suit my needs. Up until this point I
						had largely avoided anything related to the server. I became really interested in the
						interplay between client and server, and I discovered how much I enjoyed backend
						development.</p> <p class="font-light">This recognition inspired me to explore other backend tools and technologies. This was
						when I was first introduced to Go. Initially, there were a few hurdles to my
						understanding, but I quickly came to enjoy the pillars of simplicity and explicitness
						that it encouraged.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2024 / Latter-Half Cont.</span> - Started University</h4> <p class="font-light">I began my first year as an Honors CS student at the University of Central Florida (<abbr title="University of Central Florida">UCF</abbr>) and joined Knight Hacksâ€”a club which has had a major impact on my journey as a
						developer. Through Knight Hacks, I attended my first two hackathons which reinforced my
						passion about development and collaboration.</p> <p class="font-light"><strong>Projects:</strong> <!>, <!>, <!></p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2025</span> - First Job in Tech</h4> <p class="font-light">After a semester of university, I wanted to take on a job in addition to my courses. I

A few weeks later I became a <!> at <abbr title="University of Central Florida">UCF</abbr>.</p></li> <li><h4><span class="text-secondary">2025</span> - CLI and Lower-Level Development</h4> <p class="font-light">As I continued my exploration of the many fields in software, Rust caught my interest.
						Since then, Rust has become one of my main areas of focus in my free time. In addition

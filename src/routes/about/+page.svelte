	Software is a unique craft—it blends creativity, logic, and global scale in one of the most
	accessible packages. I didn't always plan on working with it, but its hard to ignore the near
	limitless potential to learn, build, and share.

<p class="font-light">
	When I write software, I aim for it to be no more than it needs to be and no less than it should
	be. There is always a balance to strike between elegant architecture and practical constraints.
	Finding that balance can be a challenge. I've found that prioritzing maintainability not only
	makes working with the code easier, but it also naturally encourages a more balanced design.

<p class="font-light">
	I've found that building is the best way to learn. Whether its a new idea or a new tool,
	struggling through implementatino is what lets us build intuition and internalize patterns of
	solutions. Reading has its place (and I do it often), but nothing can replace the lessons learned
	struggling through real development.

<p class="font-light">
	Complexity is possibly <em>the</em> key challenge of writing software. Handling it sometimes requires
	finding the right abstraction, but sometimes it requires recognizing that no abstraction is needed.
	I'm fascinated by the many philosophies and heuristics that attempt to solve the challenge of complexity
	as they reveal how much nuance there is in crafting effective software.

	Above all, however, are people. Fellow developers and users alike. I try never to lose sight of
	that. Communication isn't a secondary concern; its often what projects live and die on. It's the
